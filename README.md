# PREGO use cases

Here we have a collection of some ways to use PREGO knowledge base.

## Term collection from biological questions

There are cases that microbiologists are focused on specific environmental 
characteristics in their research. An important abiotic characteristic of 
environments is salinity. As climate change accelarates, salinity in various
habitats is also increased and an important challenge is the advancements
of agriculture crops with microbiome symbiotes tolerant in high salinity.

PREGO, being a data and metadata aggregator, can provide microbes and their 
processes that are associated with Environmental Ontology terms of saline 
environments. These are: 

```
ENVO:00000017	saline hydrographic feature
ENVO:00000019	saline lake
ENVO:00000054	saline marsh
ENVO:00000055	saline evaporation pond
ENVO:00000226	saline wedge estuary
ENVO:00000240	saline wetland
ENVO:00000279	saline pan
ENVO:00002010	saline water
ENVO:00002012	hypersaline water
ENVO:00002121	alkaline salt lake
ENVO:00002197	saline water aquarium
ENVO:00002209	saline lake sediment
ENVO:00005775	salt contaminated soil
ENVO:01000022	marine salt marsh biome
ENVO:01000307	saline water environment
ENVO:00002252	solonchak
ENVO:00002255	solonetz
ENVO:00000369	brine pool
ENVO:00003044	brine
```

Searching the PREGO knowledge base for the above terms results in multilayer network
data, environments, microbes and processes as compliled from the Literature, 
Environmental Samples and Annotated Genomes.
